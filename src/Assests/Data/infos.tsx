        lyrics: `
            In my chest, a heart beats that can't find the words
            Holding secrets, dreams, fears, never to be heard
            Beside her, the girl who fills my days with light
            But words escape me, my melodies take flight

            She walks by, and my world spins in slow motion
            But I'm silent, and silence is my ocean

            I want to shout my love, but I just take a deep breath 
            This love consuming me is deeper than the depths
            She's my everything, my calm and my storm's rage
            But I'm the guy who loves, without the skill to engage

            She smiles, and I'm lost in every little thing
            Wish I could tell her she's the reason that I sing
            But I'm the silent lover, who inside does speak
            And on the outside, can't move past the mystique

            Maybe one day, words will come without a fight
            And I can show her this love isn't a soliloquy in the night

            I want to shout my love, but I just take a deep breath 
            This love consuming me is deeper than the depths
            She's my everything, my calm and my storm's rage
            But I'm the guy who loves, without the skill to engage

            Until then, here I am, loving in silence
            Waiting for the moment to overcome my own defiance
